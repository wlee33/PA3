Indirectly lost memory can be induced by creating a structure with dynamically allocated components and not freeing the parent node. 
In doing so, the parent node, which has sole access to the children nodes, becomes unreachable and therefore lost. As a result the children nodes then become indirectly lost. This can be seen in leakyindirect.c and the corrosponding valgrind output in leakyindirect.valgrind.out.
