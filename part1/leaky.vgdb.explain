At the begining of execution before the first malloc call on line 8, valgrind shows that all heap blocks are free and no leaks are possible.

Directly after the execution of the malloc call on line 8, valgrind indicates that there are 8 bytes of memory allocated in 1 block. This memory corrosponds to the space allocated for the char* str.

After the execution of line 10, the last line which accesses the allocated memory, valgrind reports that the 8 bytes allocated to the char* are now definitely lost. Additionally valgrind reports that 1024 bytes are still reachable in 1 block, this is due to the fprintf statement on line 10.
